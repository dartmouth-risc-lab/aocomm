We construct a base station by colocating a pulsed laser and a photodetector using a beamsplitter. The remote asset, submerged in a water tank without any optical enclosures, consists of a total internal reflection (TIR)-based retroreflector and an ultrasonic transducer. The only waterproofing requirement is for the back surface of the retroreflector, which must remain sealed to maintain total internal reflection. The laser beam emitted from the base station is retroreflected by the remote asset. The ultrasonic transducer modulates this reflected light using the acousto-optic effect to encode a binary bitstream. The base station’s high-speed photodetector captures the modulated retroreflected light, which is then amplified via a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and subsequently decoded to recover the transmitted binary information.
