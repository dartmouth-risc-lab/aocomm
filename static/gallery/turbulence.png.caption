(a) The figure illustrates water currents introduced into the communication system using a voltage-controlled wheel with a diameter of 6.2 cm. The oscilloscope displays the received signal [1 0 1 1 0], where each peak corresponds to transmitted data with its 3-bit redundancy, despite the presence of water currents. (b) The image captures bubbles generated by these currents as they interfere with the backscattered beam transmitting the data. (c) The BER, plotted against linear currents, demonstrates the system's performance. Even at higher currents of 2 m/s, the BER remains within an acceptable range, indicating the system's resilience to flow-induced disturbances despite the presence of bubbles in the communication beam’s path.
