AOM Experimental Setup: (a) Figure shows the experimental configuration for Raman–Nath diffraction using an Acousto-Optic Modulator (AOM). The retroreflected laser beam is focused onto a localized region of the AOM crystal, which performs phase modulation necessary for communication. The modulated beam is then detected by a photodetector at the base station. The blue arrows show the light path and the components like retroreflector (RR), lens, AOM, laser, photodetector (PD) are marked accordingly. (b) We visualize the photodetector outputs for the AOM operating at 39 MHz, with communication occurring at 13 Mbps. Each signal contains 1000 bits, and the bits (0 and 1) are separated by a threshold line at 150 mV. We show three representative output traces demonstrating consistent signal clarity.
